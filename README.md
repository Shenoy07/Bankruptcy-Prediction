# Bankruptcy-Prediction

This was a project that I made for my DATA PROGRAMMING class.

The data were collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009. Company bankruptcy was defined based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange. 
The target variable has binary values making this a classification problem
We obtained the data from Kaggle, the URL for the same is mentioned below. The below links are the references we used over the course of this project.
